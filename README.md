## Baseball Dataset
This dataset contains 1157 players' handedness(left\right), height(inch), weight(pound), hr and avg.

## Summary
The goal is find out the correlation of variables of height, weight and handedness with the two players performance statistics of avg and hr, and also which ranges of weight and height have the best performance. Using the scatterplot and histogram, the data shows that heavier and taller players would have a slightly higher hr value, players in the weight range of 230-240 and height range of 70-75 have the best hr performance. And taller players have lower avg, weight generally doesn't have much effect on this value, players in the weight range of 140-150 and height range of 65-70 have the best avg performance.
