## Summary
The goal is find out the correlation of variables of height, weight and handedness with the two players performance statistics of avg and hr, and also which ranges of weight and height have the best performance. Using the scatterplot and histogram, the data shows that heavier and taller players would have a slightly higher hr value, players in the weight range of 230-240 and height range of 70-75 have the best hr performance. And taller players have lower avg, weight generally doesn't have much effect on this value, players in the weight range of 140-150 and height range of 65-70 have the best avg performance.

## Design

**players overview - handeness**

Barchart is used to display the count of different handedness, and piechart shows the percentage of each.

**players overview - weight&height**

This page shows the distributions of weight and height. Here, I chose the histogram to display the distribution. Boxplot also added for better understanding.

**avg-stat-distribution of avg**

This page shows the distributions of avg using histogram, also boxplot added for better understanding. One plot excluding the value of 0, the other not.

**avg-stat-height**

This page shows the correlation between avg and height using scatterplot, also scatterplots regarding percentiles of 95 and 5.

**avg-stat-weight**

This page shows the correlation between avg and weight using scatterplot, also scatterplots regarding percentiles of 95 and 5.

**avg-height&weight range**

This page shows average avg value in different ranges of height and weight.

**hr-stat-distribution of hr**

This page shows the distributions of hr using histogram, also boxplot added for better understanding. One plot excluding the value of 0, the other not.

**hr-stat-weight**

This page shows the correlation between hr and weight using scatterplot, also scatterplots regarding percentiles of 95 and 5.

**hr-stat-height**

This page shows the correlation between hr and height using scatterplot, also scatterplots regarding percentiles of 95 and 5.

**hr-height&weight range**

This page shows average hr value in different ranges of height and weight.

**hr-avg-stat**

This page shows the correlation between hr and avg using scatterplot, a third variable added into the scatterplot using the divergent color and different color, such as handedness, height and weight.

**conclusion**

## Feedback

Based on the feedback from my colleage, boxplots were added to those histograms of hr, avg, weight and height for better visualization and understanding of the data.
